Used guide here (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file) for file picker
and (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/Using_files_from_web_applications) for using the received file.

limit uploads only to images, and only one at at time

Currently the only way to access images is to get All Of Them! Obviously this is crazy but ok for a proof of concept
